        <h1> Why this matters.</h1>
        <p> I created SugarBalance because during my years of high-school, I would always experience feeling tired or low of energy. 
            I would sleep my whole day away if I wanted to. As a student-athlete, I would eat 3 meals a day, maybe 4 and still felt low in energy. 
            After sophomore year of college, I finally got blood work done and found out I had low blood sugar. I wasn't surprised because I knew their had to be something wrong with me. 
            After realizing, I didn't know where to look. I was stuck looking on google and reading articles that were not helpful. I wanted to create a space where people like me can come and find resources and tips to help them manage their blood sugar.
         Especially as an athlete, I need meals to give me energy through the day as well. It was so hard trying to find well balanced meals that help me maintain my levels at a standard. I hope this website can help people like me who struggle with blood sugar and want to live a balanced life.</p>

        <p>Blood sugar levels that rise above normal is called Hyperglycemia and they are frequently caused by insufficient insulin production or ineffective insulin utilization as in diabetes.  Excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, and blurred vision are typical symptoms.
